# Recipe Resolving

To reduce the storage on the controller required by recipes, <br>
one can resolve them to only the `Container Position` and <br>
the `Spice Amount`.

## Container Position

The position can be determined by taking the spice's <br>
name and searching for the corresponding container <br>
in the spices configuration.
